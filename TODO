? = maybe
I = in progress

I Make the user interface more intuitive
I Internationalize the user interface
  (The basics are done, all that's needed now is more translations.)
o Add a database of known OpenGL applications that can be picked from
  a menu instead of forcing all users to find out the right executable
  name themselves.
o Fix combobox "Add setting" in simple ui
o Modernize: port to python3 and gtk3 (probably pygtkcompat)
o Add gpu chooser for PRIME like https://github.com/ChristophHaag/gpuchooser. Handle "loader" driver in the UI.
? Drag and drop in the configuration tree, allowing to move device and
  application configurations between configuration files and application
  configurations between devices.
