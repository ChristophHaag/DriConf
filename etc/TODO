X Use different widgets for different option types and valid ranges
X Handle invalid configuration files read from disk
X Reset individual options to their default value
X Handle invalid option values in configuration files read from disk
X Handle xdriinfo and driver problems gracefully
X Reload configuration files
X Port to gtk-2 (driconf versions 0.2.x)
X Make the user interface more intuitive
  (The new user interface in version 0.9.x is probably as intuitive as
   it's ever going to get.)
I Internationalize the user interface
  (The basics are done, all that's needed now is more translations.)
o Add a database of known OpenGL applications that can be picked from
  a menu instead of forcing all users to find out the right executable
  name themselves.
? Drag and drop in the configuration tree, allowing to move device and
  application configurations between configuration files and application
  configurations between devices.
  (As of version 0.9.x the old user interface has a low priority.)
