DRI configuration GUI

This is the first graphical configuration tool for DRI. There probably
still a lot of work to do and probably many bugs to fix. But I want to
make it available as soon as possible in order to get more feedback on
the config-0-0-1-branch in DRI CVS.

In order to use it you need the config-0-0-1-branch from DRI CVS. For
instructions on downloading and installing CVS branches see the
documentation on dri.sf.net.

This tool is written in Python. Before installing make sure that a
Python version and the matching packages xml.parsers.expat and
python-gtk are installed. Set the variables PYTHON and PREFIX in
install.sh according to your system. Then run ./install.sh. If
everything goes well you should see something like:

    Byte compiling dri.py ... done.
    Byte compiling driconf.py ... done.
    Byte compiling driconf_tb_icons.py ... done.
    Installing dri.pyo to /usr/local/lib/python2.1 ... done.
    Installing driconf.pyo to /usr/local/lib/python2.1 ... done.
    Installing driconf_tb_icons.pyo to /usr/local/lib/python2.1 ... done.
    Installing driconf to /usr/local/bin ... done.

After successful installation you can run driconf from the shell.

Enjoy ...
