driconf-0.0.7: Mon Aug 25 23:43:34 CEST 2003
- If an application or device is selected the save button saves the containing
  configuration file.
- Tries to write the default configuration for non-existing configuration
  files on startup showing a message dialog if successful.
- Non-existent and non-creatable config files don't show up in the config tree.
- Existing but non-writable config files are read-only, all the toolbar buttons
  and configuration widgets are unsensitive.
- Fixed: Error message about failed xdriinfo generated an exception itself :-/

driconf-0.0.6: Thu Aug 21 03:40:37 CEST 2003

- Added a custom GtkOptionMenu-like widget for enums that wraps lines
- Display options' XML elements as tooltip
- Make widgets of disabled options unsensitive
- Fixed: workaround for a strange problem with a modal dialog opened in the
  select_row callback of a ctree with selection mode SELECTION_BROWSE. It
  locked up the entire X session in a way that no more input was accepted!
- Fixed: popen2.Popen3 didn't seem to work from inside gtk callbacks.

driconf-0.0.5: Sat Aug 16 15:41:12 CEST 2003

- Adjust toolbar button sensitivity to selected config tree item
- Reset individual options to their default value
- Display translated description as option label, name and type as tooltip
- Use popen2.Popen3 so that xdriinfo's stderr can be captured to produce
  more helpful error messages
- Fixed: show an error message dialog if xdriinfo fails on program startup

driconf-0.0.4: Mon Jul 28 23:20:16 CEST 2003

driconf-0.0.2: Sun Jul 13 23:35:00 CEST 2003

  application config
- Fixed: Select a default language (en) and encoding (iso-8859-1) if not
         defined by the locale (e.g. "C")

driconf-0.0.1: Sun Jul 13 19:29:12 CEST 2003

- Added CHANGELOG
