I Make the user interface more intuitive
  (This one may never be really done. I'm open to suggestions, but I think
   it's grown pretty usable.)
I Internationalize the user interface
  (The basics are done, all that's needed now is more translations.)
o Drag and drop in the configuration tree, allowing to move device and
  application configurations between configuration files and application
  configurations between devices.
