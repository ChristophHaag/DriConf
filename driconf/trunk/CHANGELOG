- Save button is only sensitive on modified configs.
- No more annoying message box after saving successfully.
- Ask before losing changes on exit.
- Load configuration files before opening the main window.
- Show a message box if the driver's config info has errors.
- Make all dialogs transient windows for the main window, improves placement.

driconf-0.0.8: Sun Sep 28 12:31:48 CEST 2003

- Added a special section page for options that appear in a configuration file
  but are unknown to the driver (only shows up if necessary).
- Improved error handling/reporting in case of invalid driver config info.
- Improved handling of invalid option values.
- Highlight applications with invalid options in the configuration tree.

driconf-0.0.7: Mon Aug 25 23:43:34 CEST 2003

- If an application or device is selected the save button saves the containing
  configuration file.
- Tries to write the default configuration for non-existing configuration
  files on startup showing a message dialog if successful.
- Non-existent and non-creatable config files don't show up in the config tree.
- Existing but non-writable config files are read-only, all the toolbar buttons
  and configuration widgets are unsensitive.
- Fixed: Error message about failed xdriinfo generated an exception itself :-/

driconf-0.0.6: Thu Aug 21 03:40:37 CEST 2003

- Display options' XML elements as tooltip
- Make widgets of disabled options unsensitive
- Fixed: workaround for a strange problem with a modal dialog opened in the
  select_row callback of a ctree with selection mode SELECTION_BROWSE. It
  locked up the entire X session in a way that no more input was accepted!
- Fixed: popen2.Popen3 didn't seem to work from inside gtk callbacks.

- Adjust toolbar button sensitivity to selected config tree item

  more helpful error messages

         defined by the locale (e.g. "C")
