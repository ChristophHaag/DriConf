DRI configuration GUI

This is the first graphical configuration tool for DRI. There is still
a lot of work to do and probably many bugs to fix. But I want to make
it available as soon as possible in order to get more feedback on the
config-0-0-1-branch in DRI CVS.

In order to use it you need the config-0-0-1-branch from DRI CVS. For
instructions on downloading and installing CVS branches see the
documentation on dri.sf.net.

This tool is written in Python. Before installing make sure that a
Python version and the matching packages xml.parsers.expat and
python-gtk are installed. The installation uses Python's distutils
package.

By default driconf will be installed into /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/lib/python?.?/site-packages. You can change this using the
prefix option in setup.cfg. For installing run the following command
as root:

python setup.py install

If everything goes well you should see something like this:

running install
running build
running build_py
creating build
creating build/lib
copying dri.py -> build/lib
copying driconf.py -> build/lib
copying driconf_xpm.py -> build/lib
running build_scripts
creating build/scripts
copying and adjusting driconf -> build/scripts
running install_lib
copying build/lib/driconf.py -> /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages
copying build/lib/dri.py -> /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages
copying build/lib/driconf_xpm.py -> /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages
byte-compiling /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/driconf.py to driconf.pyc
byte-compiling /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/dri.py to dri.pyc
byte-compiling /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/driconf_xpm.py to driconf_xpm.pyc
running install_scripts
copying build/scripts/driconf -> /usr/local/bin
changing mode of /usr/local/bin/driconf to 100755

After successful installation you can run driconf from the shell.

Enjoy ...
