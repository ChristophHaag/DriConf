DRI configuration GUI

This is the first graphical configuration tool for DRI. In order to
use it you need a recent development verion of DRI. You can either
download the DRI source code from CVS or install a binary
snapshot. You find information about both on
http://dri.sourceforge.net.

This tool is written in Python. Before installing make sure that a
Python version and the matching packages xml.parsers.expat and
python-gtk are installed. Note that there are now two series of
DRIConf for gtk-1.2 and gtk-2 respectively. The gtk-1.2 series uses
version numbers 0.1.xx, the gtk-2 versions are labeled 0.2.xx. The
installation uses Python's distutils package.

By default driconf will be installed into /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages. You can change this using the
prefix option in setup.cfg. For installing run the following command
as root:

python setup.py install

If everything goes well you should see something like this:

running install
running build
running build_py
creating build
creating build/lib
copying dri.py -> build/lib
copying driconf.py -> build/lib
copying driconf_xpm.py -> build/lib
running build_scripts
creating build/scripts
copying and adjusting driconf -> build/scripts
running install_lib
copying build/lib/driconf.py -> /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages
copying build/lib/dri.py -> /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages
copying build/lib/driconf_xpm.py -> /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages
byte-compiling /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/driconf.py to driconf.pyc
byte-compiling /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/dri.py to dri.pyc
byte-compiling /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/driconf_xpm.py to driconf_xpm.pyc
running install_scripts
copying build/scripts/driconf -> /usr/local/bin
changing mode of /usr/local/bin/driconf to 100755

After successful installation you can run driconf from the shell.

Enjoy ...
