driconf-0.9.0: Thu Jan 26 22:39:20 EST 2006

- This version introduces a completely redesigned user interface. If
  the old user interface looked more like the GNOME configuration
  editor then the new one is more like a configuration applet. The old
  user interface is still available as "expert mode".
- Now requires pygtk 2.4 or newer.
- Translations need updates!

Changes in the old user interface (expert mode):
- New and Delete buttons in Unknown tabs renamed to Add and Remove.
- Only allow adding and renaming of unknown options if there is no
  driver information available.
- Automatically turn entries into appropriate widgets when invalid
  values are replaced with valid ones by the user.
- Fixed: prevent editing/adding/removing of unknown options in
  read-only files.

driconf-0.2.7: Thu Aug 11 18:47:39 EDT 2005

- Italian translation by Giampaolo Bozzali.
- Russian translation by Konstantin A. Lepikhov.
- Changed installation. Python modules are now installed into
  /usr/local/lib/driconf.

driconf-0.2.6: Thu Apr 14 01:08:41 CEST 2005

- Spanish translation by David Rubio Miguélez.
- .po-files included in the source release.
- Look for translations in the current directory first. This makes it easier
  to test new translations when older ones are installed in the standard place.
- Use gtk-2.6 AboutDialog if available.
- Changed handling of long tab labels. This gets rid of visual artifacts on
  truncated tab labels+tooltips with some gtk themes.
- Fixed: lots of deprecation warnings with pygtk 2.6 about gtk.TRUE and
         gtk.FALSE. Now using True and False, requires Python 2.3.
- Fixed: small problems with the Makefile for maintaining translations.

driconf-0.2.5: Sun Mar 27 15:32:59 CEST 2005

- I18N support, initial German translation. More translations are welcome.
- Eye-candy: icons, bold configuration file names in the configuration tree,
             bold application frame label.
- Slightly larger initial window size, but allow resizing to smaller sizes.
- No more annoying popup-dialog about unknown options. The "Unknown" page was
  moved to the first place for attention and contains a help-button that
  displays a short help text.
- Unknown options are now editable, both their names and values, new settings
  can be added to the list of unknown options.
- Allow configuration of unkown drivers the same way as unknown options of
  known drivers.
- Allow changing the screen and driver of existing device configurations.
- Invalid settings are no longer highlighted when disabled.
- Fixed: spin-buttons for integers had a decimal point.
- Fixed: markup in the configuration tree was broken (only visible with
         invalid settings).
- Fixed: assertion failure when deleting driver or application configurations.
- Fixed: escape all text that is passed to Pango as markup.
- Fixed: there was a possibility that a read-only configuration was selected
         on startup even though a writable one existed.
